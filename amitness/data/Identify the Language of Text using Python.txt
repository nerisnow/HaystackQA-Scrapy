Text Language Identification is the process of predicting the language of a given piece of text. You might have encountered it when Chrome shows a popup to translate a webpage when it detects that the content is not in English. Behind the scenes, Chrome is using a model to predict the language of text used on a webpage.When working with a dataset for NLP, the corpus may contain a mixed set of languages. Here, language identification can be useful to either filter out a few languages or to translate the corpus to a single language and then use it for your downstream tasks.In this post, I will explain the working mechanism and usage of various language detection libraries. is an open-source library in Python for word embeddings and text classification. It is built for production use cases rather than research and hence is optimized for performance and size. It extends the  model with ideas such as using  and .For our purpose of language identification, we can use the pre-trained fasttext language identification models. The model was trained on a dataset drawn from , , and . The basic idea is to prepare training data of (text, language) pairs and then train a classifier on it.The benchmark below shows that these pre-trained language detection models are better than , another popular python language detection library. Fasttext has better accuracy and also the inference time is very fast. It supports a wide variety of languages including French, German, English, Spanish, Chinese.The model returns two tuples. One of them is an array of language labels and the other is the confidence for each sentence. Here  is the  code for French. The model is 96.56% confident that the language is French.Fasttext returns the ISO code for the most probable one among the 170 languages. You can refer to the page on  codes to find language for each symbol.Google also provides a compact pretrained model for language identification called . It supports 107 languages.To use it, first install  from pip as:After installation, you can initialize the model as shown below.Once loaded, the model can be used to predict the language of a text as shown below:From the returned result, you can get the language BCP-47 style language code. The mapping of code to language is available .You can also get the confidence of the model from the result.You can also get the reliability of the prediction from the result object.Instead of predicting a single language,  also provides a method to get confidence over multiple languages.For example, we can get the top-2 predicted languages as:Thus, we learned how pretrained models can be used for language detection in Python. This is very useful to filter out non-English responses in NLP projects and handle them.Text Language Identification is the process of predicting the language of a given piece of text.
