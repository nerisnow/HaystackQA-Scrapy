Hugging Face recently released  for almost 140 languages on their model hub.These models were originally trained by  of the . They were trained on the  using a neural machine translation framework called .In this post, I will explain how you can use the MarianMT models to augment data text data.We will use a data augmentation technique called “Back Translation”. In this, we take an original text written in English. Then, we convert it into another language (eg. French) using MarianMT. We translate the French text back into English using MarianMT. We keep the back-translated English text if it is different from the original English sentence.First, we need to install Hugging Face transformers and Moses Tokenizers with the following commandAfter installation, we can now import the MarianMT model and tokenizer.Then, we can create a initialize the model that can translate from English to Romance languages. This is a single model that can translate to any of the romance languages()Similarly, we can initialize models that can translate Romance languages to English.Next, we write a helper function to translate a batch of text given the machine translation model, tokenizer and the target romance language.Next, we will prepare a function to use the above  function to perform back translation.Now, we can perform data augmentation using back-translation from English to Spanish on a list of sentences as shown below.Similarly, we can perform augmentation using English to French as shown below with the exact same helper method.You can also run back translation in a chain to get more diversity. For example, Here are language codes for a subset of major romance language that you can use above.To view all available language codes, you can runBesides data augmentation, the back translation process can also be used for text paraphrasing.Similarly, we can also use it as an adversarial attack. Suppose we have a training dataset on which we trained an NLP model. Then, we can augment the training dataset and generate prediction from our model on augmented texts. If the predictions are different than our ground-truth labels, then we have a list of texts where our model fails. We can get good insights by analyzing those responses.Thus, MarianMT is a decent free and offline alternative to Google Translate for back-translation.Hugging Face recently released  for almost 140 languages on their model hub.These models were originally trained by  of the .
